The GAA is an Irish amateur sporting organisation focused on promoting Gaelic Games, including the 
traditional Irish sports of hurling and Gaelic football. To most Irish people, it is their community's 
heartbeat, where pride and passion for their respective counties are paramount. With Dublin's current 
dominance as the Gaelic football aristocrat following Kilkenny's grip on the hurling titles earlier in the 
decade, people might be wondering if this was always the case and whether their county was ever 
prosperous over the years. Therefore, I have created two data visualisations of All-Ireland winners 
throughout the decades in both hurling and Gaelic Football - from its inception in 1887 to last summer's 
champions. The bar race animation illustrates the top 12 counties as the years go by - with teams joining, 
leaving, and maintaining top positions as one of Ireland's successful outfits in Gaelic games. The concept 
is similar to the interactive map, where you can see the winners in a specific year. By clicking on the 
respective winning county, you can see interesting statistics like the number of titles won at that time, 
county grounds, how many scores were in the final, while also determining the winning margin.
